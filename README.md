1. Number Calculator  
2. QR Code Generator  
3. Video to ASCII Art  
4. Text to Audio Converter  
  
## Project Details  
  
### 1. Number Calculator  
  
This is a simple GUI calculator coded using Tkinter in Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations and provides a user-friendly interface.  
  
- [Code: calculator.py](https://github.com/akhilpsin/Python-Mini_projects/blob/master/Calculator/calculator.py)  
  
### 2. QR Code Generator  
  
This is a simple GUI QR code generator coded using Tkinter in Python. It generates QR codes for the given input and displays them on the screen.  
  
- [Code: Qr_code_generator.py](https://github.com/akhilpsin/Python-Mini_projects/blob/master/QR%20code%20generator/Qr_code_generator.py)  
  
### 3. Video to ASCII Art  
  
It is a simple Python code to play videos in the terminal/cmd using characters as pixels.  
  
- [Code: vid_asci_code.py](https://github.com/akhilpsin/Python-Mini_projects/blob/master/Video%20to%20ASCI%20conversion/vid_asci_code.py)  
  
### 4. Text to Audio Converter  
  
It is a simple Python code to convert text to audio in mp3 format.  
  
- [Code: Text_to_speech.py](https://github.com/akhilpsin/Python-Mini_projects/blob/master/Text_to_speach/Text_to_speech.py)  
  
## Usage  
  
Each project folder contains a Python script file (.py) which can be run using a Python interpreter.
